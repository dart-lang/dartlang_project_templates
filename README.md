# oss_project_templates

OSS project templates, for use in starting new repos.

## Using

When creating a new Dart package, start with either the
[dart-lang](https://github.com/dart-lang/oss_project_templates/tree/master/dart-github-dart-lang)
template, if your project is going in `github.com/dart-lang`, or the 
[dart-lang](https://github.com/dart-lang/oss_project_templates/tree/master/dart-github-dart-lang)
[google](https://github.com/dart-lang/oss_project_templates/tree/master/dart-github-google)
template, if your project is going in `github.com/google`.

## Configuring

Both templates have a `todo.txt` in the root directory, which list a series of steps
to rename the newly created project away from the vanilla template.
